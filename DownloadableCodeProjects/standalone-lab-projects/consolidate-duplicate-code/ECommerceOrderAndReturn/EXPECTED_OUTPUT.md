/*
EXPECTED OUTPUT WHEN RUNNING THE APPLICATION:

=== E-Commerce Order and Return Processing System ===
Starting application tests...

TEST 1: Processing a valid order
- Should show order validation steps
- Should calculate shipping (free shipping for $75.50 order)
- Should process payment successfully
- Should reserve inventory for all items
- Should complete without errors

TEST 2: Processing a valid return
- Should show return validation steps
- Should validate return eligibility
- Should calculate return shipping (processing fee only for high-value return)
- Should process refund successfully
- Should update inventory
- Should complete without errors

TEST 3: Processing an invalid order (security test)
- Should fail ID format validation
- Should show security check failure
- Should handle error gracefully

TEST 4: Processing an invalid return (security test)
- Should detect XSS attempt
- Should fail length validation
- Should handle error gracefully

TEST 5: Processing with empty ID
- Should fail null/empty validation
- Should handle error gracefully

VALIDATION POINTS:
✓ All security validations work correctly
✓ Shipping calculations are accurate
✓ Error handling is robust
✓ Business rules are enforced
✓ Output is consistent and informative

AFTER REFACTORING:
- The exact same output should be produced
- All test scenarios should behave identically
- No functionality should be lost
- Performance should be maintained or improved
