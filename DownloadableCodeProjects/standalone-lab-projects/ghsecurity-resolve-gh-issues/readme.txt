The code project should be a small "real-world" code project that contains security vulnerabilities relevant to the app domain (either eCommerce or data processing). 

Code projects should use sample data and console outputs to observe behaviors before and after resolving issues.

Issues: the issues focus on code patterns and logic flaws (e.g., injection, weak cryptography, improper data handling).

Important: the code security issues can't include any secrets or credentials that would trigger automated GitHub secret scanning alerts. GH secret scanning is covered separately.
