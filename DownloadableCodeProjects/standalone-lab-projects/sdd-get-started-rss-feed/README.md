The "Get started with spec-driven development and GitHub Spec Kit" module includes a lab exercise for a greenfield RSS/Atom feed reader project. The lab guides you through building a practical application while applying spec-driven development principles. The StakeholderDocuments folder contains key documentation files for the project, including:

- Project Goals.md
- App Features.md
- Tech Stack.md
- MVP System Rules.md

GitHub Spec Kits commands will use these files to help you generate the constitution, spec, plan, and tasks files.
