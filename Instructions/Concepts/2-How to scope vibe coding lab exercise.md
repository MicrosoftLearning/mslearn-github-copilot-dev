## Vibe coding project types

The coding projects for a lab exercise need to be carefully scoped, either narrowly or specifically to accommodate 20-30+ minute exercises.

1. Start from scratch projects (implement basics, stub features, page navigation, but little or no app data)

    1. Create a prototype eCommerce app

        Example prompt:

        - I need to create a prototype eCommerce app using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
        - The prototype eCommerce app must provide a dynamic user interface that automatically scales to accommodate viewing on desktop and phone devices.
        - The eCommerce app should include the following pages: products list, product details, shopping cart, and checkout. Each page should provide basic functionality and forward/back navigation between pages.
        - Use a simple dataset of 10 fruit products. Include: product name, description, price per unit (where unit could be the number of items or ounces, pounds, etc.), and a simple image that represents the product.
        - The products list page should display a list of products with basic information such as product name, price per unit, and image. The products list page should also provide a way to select a quantity of a product, and an option to add selected items to the shopping cart.
        - The product details page should display detailed information about a selected product, including product name, description, price per unit, and image. The product details page should also provide a way to navigate back to the products list page.
        - The shopping cart page should display a list of products added to the cart, including product name, quantity, and total price. The shopping cart page should also provide a way to update the quantity of products in the cart, and remove products from the cart.
        - The checkout page should display a summary of the products in the cart, including product name, quantity, and total price. The checkout page should also provide a way to confirm the order. 
        - The prototype eCommerce app should provide basic navigation between pages. Create a collapsible navigation bar on the left side of the products list, product details, shopping cart, and checkout pages. The navigation bar should allow users to navigate between the products list, product details, shopping cart, and checkout pages.
        - The prototype eCommerce app should have basic styling to make it visually appealing, but it does not need to be fully responsive or polished.
        - The prototype eCommerce app Will not include any backend functionality, such as user authentication, payment processing, or database integration. It will be a static prototype that demonstrates the basic concepts of an eCommerce app.

    1. Create a prototype for an AI enhanced app (using Python and Hugging Face models)

1. Add a new feature to a project

    1. Add a new feature to an existing app
        - For example, add a search feature to the eCommerce app.
        - The search feature should allow users to search for products by name or description.
        - The search results should display a list of products that match the search criteria, including product name, price per unit, and image.
        - The search feature should be accessible from the products list page and should provide a way to navigate back to the products list page.

    1. Add a new page to an existing app

        - For example, add a contact us page to the eCommerce app.
        - The contact us page should include a form that allows users to submit their name, email address, and message.
        - The contact us page should also provide a way to navigate back to the products list page.

1. Change a tool, framework, or technology projects

    1. Change the front-end framework of an existing app

        - For example, change the front-end framework of the eCommerce app from JavaScript to React or Angular.
        - The new front-end framework should provide the same functionality as the original app, including product listing, product details, shopping cart, and checkout.
        - The new front-end framework should also provide a dynamic user interface that automatically scales to accommodate viewing on desktop and phone devices.

    1. Change the back-end technology of an existing app

        - For example, change the back-end technology of the eCommerce app from Node.js to Python Flask or Django.
        - The new back-end technology should provide the same functionality as the original app, including user authentication, payment processing, and database integration.

1. Code review and improvement projects

    1. Add logging to a project
    1. Add unit tests to a project

1. Coding language conversion projects

    Convert and existing app to a different language or framework.

    For example convert a Python app to a Java app or a C# app.

1. Redesign the architecture projects (too big)
