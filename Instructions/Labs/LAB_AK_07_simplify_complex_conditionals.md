# Simplify complex conditionals using GitHub Copilot

Conditional logic is often complex in business applications, especially in domains like e-commerce pricing and financial services. Deeply nested and complex conditionals can make code difficult to read, maintain, and test.

In this exercise, you use GitHub Copilot to analyze code that contains deeply nested conditional logic, refactor the code logic, and then test the refactored code to ensure it works as intended. You use GitHub Copilot in Ask mode to gain an understanding of the code and explore options simplifying the logic. You use GitHub Copilot in Agent mode to refactor the code by extracting complex conditional logic into smaller, focused helper methods. By breaking down complex conditionals into smaller methods, you improve the maintainability and readability of the code.

This exercise should take approximately **30** minutes to complete.

> **IMPORTANT**: To complete this exercise, you must provide your own GitHub account and GitHub Copilot subscription. If you don't have a GitHub account, you can <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">sign up</a> for a free individual account and use a GitHub Copilot Free plan to complete the exercise.

## Exercise scenario

You're a software developer working for a consulting firm. New clients need help refactoring complex conditional logic to improve code maintainability and readability. You're assigned to the following apps:

- E-commerce pricing engine: The first app is an E-commerce Pricing Engine that calculates dynamic pricing based on various business rules. Conditionals include membership levels, order values, coupon codes, product categories, and shipping rules.
- Loan approval workflow: The second app is a Loan Approval Workflow that evaluates loan applications based on various factors. Conditionals include income, employment status, debt ratios, collateral, and credit history.

This exercise includes two parts, a guided exercise that teaches you on how to refactor complex conditional logic using GitHub Copilot, and an optional "if time permits" exercise that provides an opportunity to demonstrate what you learned in a controlled environment. In the first part, you're guided through the process of refactoring complex conditional logic in the E-commerce pricing engine demo app.

The tasks in this exercise include:

1. Review the E-commerce pricing engine codebase.
1. Identify refactoring opportunities in the E-commerce pricing code.
1. Refactor the E-commerce pricing code with GitHub Copilot.
1. Test the refactored E-commerce pricing code.
1. (OPTIONAL) Refactor the complex conditional logic in the loan approval workflow demo app.

## Refactor complex conditionals using GitHub Copilot tools

GitHub Copilot provides tools that can help you refactor complex conditional logic in your code. These tools include:

- Code explanations: Copilot can explain the purpose and functionality of specific code blocks, helping you understand the existing logic.
- Code suggestions: Copilot can suggest code snippets to replace complex conditionals with simpler, more maintainable code.
- Code generation: Copilot can generate new code based on your descriptions, allowing you to implement refactoring changes quickly.

### Review the E-commerce pricing code

The first step in any refactoring effort is to ensure that you understand the existing codebase.

In this task, you'll open the E-commerce pricing engine project and use GitHub Copilot to help analyze the complex conditional logic.

Use the following steps to complete this task:

1. Ensure that you have the GHCopilotEx7LabApps folder open in Visual Studio Code.

    Refer to the **Before you start** section if you haven't downloaded the sample code projects.

1. Verify that the **ECommercePricingEngine** code project builds successfully.

    For example, in the SOLUTION EXPLORER view, right-click **ECommercePricingEngine**, and then select **Build**.

    You'll see warnings "Cannot convert null literal to non-nullable reference type." when you build the project, but there shouldn't be any errors. You can ignore the warnings for the purposes of this exercise.

1. Open the GitHub Copilot Chat view.

    If the Chat view isn't already open, you can open it by selecting the **Chat** icon at the top of the Visual Studio Code window, just to the right of the Search textbox.

1. In the Chat view, ensure that the chat mode is set to **Ask** and the model is set to **GPT-4.1**.

    These settings are available in the bottom-left corner of the Chat view. GitHub Copilot's **Ask** mode is used to ask general coding questions and to generate code related explanations. The **GPT-4.1** model, which is included with the GitHub Copilot Free plan, provides advanced capabilities for understanding and generating code.

    You'll be using Agent mode later in this exercise, but for now you'll use Ask mode for code analysis and explanations.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Some models are better suited for specific tasks than others. The model that you select can affect the responses generated by GitHub Copilot. After completing the lab exercise using the recommended settings, you may want to repeat the exercise using different models and compare the results.

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the **ECommercePricingDemo.cs** file.

    This file includes the following classes:

    - User: Represents a customer, with properties for membership level, purchase history, and special statuses (student, employee, corporate, etc.). Used to determine eligibility for various discounts and benefits.
    - Coupon: Represents a discount or shipping coupon, with properties for code, validity, type (percent or shipping), and value. Used in pricing calculations to apply additional discounts or free shipping.
    - Item: Represents a product in an order, with name, category, and price. Used to build up orders and calculate subtotals and category-specific discounts.
    - Order: Represents a customerâ€™s order, containing a list of items, shipping region, coupon, event, payment method, and other order-specific flags. Provides methods to calculate subtotals, check for category presence, and determine order characteristics (e.g., high value, mixed categories).
    - PricingEngine: Contains the main logic for calculating the final price of an order. Applies discounts based on user status, order details, coupons, and category-specific rules. Handles security checks and ensures discounts and prices stay within safe bounds.
    - Program: The entry point. Creates test users, coupons, and orders, then runs a series of complex pricing scenarios using the above classes. Demonstrates how the pricing engine applies its logic in different situations.

    Each class models a real-world entity or process in an e-commerce pricing system, and they interact in the Program class to simulate and test pricing calculations. For example, User, Order, and Coupon instances are passed to PricingEngine.CalculateFinalPrice to compute and display the final price with all applicable discounts.

1. Locate the **PricingEngine** class, and then select the entire **CalculateFinalPrice** method.

    This method contains over 8 levels of nested conditional logic that evaluates membership levels, seasonal events, corporate accounts, subscription services, and various discount scenarios.

1. Take a minute to scroll through the conditional logic in the **CalculateFinalPrice** method.

    The method is complex and difficult to read, with multiple nested conditionals that handle different discount scenarios. The complexity arises from the various business rules that need to be applied based on user status, order details, and coupon codes.

1. Right-click the selected code, and then select **Copilot** > **Explain**.

    GitHub Copilot will analyze the complex conditional logic and provide an explanation of what the code does, helping you understand the business rules before you investigate refactoring the code.

1. Take a few minutes to review GitHub Copilot's explanation.

    The explanation should highlight the main discount categories such as the hierarchical membership, coupon applications, bulk purchase incentives, and category-specific rules.

    Understanding these business domains is crucial for creating effective helper methods that help simplify the logic.

1. In the Chat view, to get a deeper analysis of the calculation process, enter the following prompt:

    ```plaintext
    @workspace Explain the business logic flow in the CalculateFinalPrice method. What are the different discount paths and how do they interact with each other? What are the key business rules that govern pricing calculations?
    ```

    This analysis should help you understand how the different discount categories interact and what business rules are applied at each step of the pricing calculation.

1. Take a few minutes to review the discount paths and other information listed in GitHub Copilot's explanation.

    The explanation should cover the main discount paths, such as:

    - **Membership Discounts**: How different membership levels (Premium, Gold, Silver) apply discounts and how first-time buyers are treated.
    - **Coupon Discounts**: How coupons are validated, applied, and how they interact with membership discounts.
    - **Bulk Discounts**: How volume-based discounts are applied based on item counts.

    Understanding the discount paths is essential for identifying refactoring opportunities.

### Identify refactoring opportunities in the E-commerce pricing code

GitHub Copilot is a great tool for analyzing complex code and identifying refactoring opportunities.

In this task, you'll use GitHub Copilot to identify specific refactoring opportunities and suggest helper methods that can simplify the complex nested conditions. You'll use the discount paths identified in the previous task to help construct a prompt for GitHub Copilot.

Use the following steps to complete this task:

1. Ensure you have the GitHub Copilot Chat view open with **Ask** mode and the **GPT-4.1** model selected.

1. Add the **ECommercePricingDemo.cs** file to the Chat context using drag-and-drop operation.

    Although ECommercePricingDemo.cs is already open in the Visual Studio Code editor, adding it to the Chat context encourages GitHub Copilot to analyze the entire code file, which can result in more accurate suggestions. Adding relevant files to the Chat context is a best practice when using GitHub Copilot, even when you include the **@workspace** or **#codebase** tags in your prompt.

1. Submit a prompt that asks GitHub Copilot to identify refactoring opportunities that improve code modularity related to the main discount paths.

    Consider the following items when constructing your prompt:

    - Tell GitHub Copilot to focus on the **CalculateFinalPrice** method and its nested conditionals.
    - Ask GitHub Copilot to suggest options that move complex logic into more manageable, single-responsibility helper methods.
    - List the main discount paths that should be considered for extraction into helper methods.
    - Emphasize the importance of maintaining the business logic while simplifying the code structure.

    It's often beneficial to have GitHub Copilot consider code interactions when analyzing your code. You can use the **@workspace** or **#codebase** tag to tell GitHub Copilot to include your entire codebase in its analysis.

    For example:

    ```plaintext
    @workspace Analyze the CalculateFinalPrice method and suggest refactoring opportunities. Suggest options that move the nested conditional logic into more manageable, single-responsibility helper methods. Focus on the main discount paths: membership discounts, coupon discounts, and bulk discounts. Maintain the business logic while simplifying the code structure.
    ```

    GitHub Copilot will analyze the method and suggest specific refactoring opportunities, identifying patterns in the nested conditionals that can be extracted into helper methods.

1. Take a couple minutes to review GitHub Copilot's suggestions.

    The response should identify several refactoring opportunities such as:

    - **CalculateMembershipDiscount**: Extract membership-level discount logic
    - **CalculateCouponDiscount**: Handle coupon validation and application
    - **CalculateBulkDiscount**: Manage volume-based discounts

1. To generate specific guidance on how to implement these helper methods, enter the following prompt:

    ```plaintext
    For each suggested helper method, explain what specific conditional logic should be extracted and how it would simplify the main method. Include the method signatures and return types that would be most appropriate.
    ```

1. Take a minute to review GitHub Copilot's detailed refactoring plan.

    The response should outline the specific logic to be extracted for each helper method, along with suggested method signatures and return types. Review the plan to ensure it aligns with the business logic and maintains the intended functionality.

1. Submit a prompt that asks GitHub Copilot how to simplify complex conditional logic and reduce nesting levels in the CalculateFinalPrice method.

    For example:

    ```plaintext
    How can I simplify the complex conditional logic and reduce nesting levels in the CalculateFinalPrice method? For example, the method has multiple nested conditionals that apply different membership discounts based on user status and order details. What are some best practices for reducing nesting levels and improving readability? Explain the benefit of each approach when applied to this method.
    ```

1. Take a minute to review GitHub Copilot's suggestions for simplifying the conditional logic and reducing nesting levels.

    GitHub Copilot will provide suggestions for simplifying the conditional logic, such as:

    - Use early returns or guard clauses to flatten logic, reduce indentation, and clarify flow.
    - Use local helper functions to remove duplication and clarify intent.
    - Use switch expressions or pattern matching to make membership logic explicit and maintainable.
    - Use smaller methods per membership to modularize logic and make it easier to test and update.
    - Use Boolean variables for conditions to improve readability of complex checks.

### Refactor the E-commerce pricing code with GitHub Copilot Agent

GitHub Copilot has three modes, **Ask**, **Edit**, and **Agent**. When running in Agent mode, GitHub Copilot works as an autonomous AI agent.

In Agent mode:

- Your prompt specifies the task to be performed.
- GitHub Copilot reviews the task and your codebase to determine the relevant files and establish context.
- GitHub Copilot formulates a process that it can use to accomplish the task. Processes implement an iterative approach and use code reviews to help ensure the task is completed successfully.
- GitHub Copilot uses the Chat view to keep you informed as it works through the assigned task. It may also provide explanations or justifications for the changes being made.
- GitHub Copilot can invoke tools to help it accomplish the task or to verify that code changes are working correctly.
- GitHub Copilot may pause during the task and ask you for assistance or clarification. It's important to monitor the chat and respond when prompted to assist the autonomous agent.
- GitHub Copilot updates your code file in the Visual Studio Code editor. Once the task is complete, you should review the changes made by GitHub Copilot before applying them to your codebase (individually or collectively).

In this section of the exercise, you'll use GitHub Copilot Agent to refactor the PricingEngine class and simplify the complex conditional logic in the CalculateFinalPrice method. The task that you assign to GitHub Copilot Agent will combine the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot in the analysis section of the previous task. Your task will focus on extracting complex conditional logic into smaller, focused helper methods and reducing nesting levels using the approaches suggested by GitHub Copilot.

Use the following steps to complete this task:

1. Ensure that the GitHub Copilot Chat view is open in Visual Studio Code.

1. In the chat view, select the **Agent** mode.

1. Evaluate the required code refactoring task.

    You need to write a task for GitHub Copilot Agent that describes how to refactor the **CalculateFinalPrice** method. Your goal is to simplify the complex conditional logic and reduce nesting levels, making the code more maintainable and readable. In the previous task, you asked GitHub Copilot to analyze the code and identify refactoring opportunities. Now, you'll use that analysis to create a task for GitHub Copilot Agent.

    Your task should include natural language text that communicates the following information:
    - Explain the overall goal of the task.
    - Identify the primary code sections that can be extracted to improve modularity.
    - Describe the specific approaches to reduce nesting levels and improve readability.
    - Describe the expected outcome of the refactoring process.




    ```plaintext
   I need to simplify the complex conditional logic and reduce nesting levels in the CalculateFinalPrice method. The main areas of complexity are associated with membership discounts, coupon processing, and bulk discounts. Each of these areas could be moved into separate helper methods that are called from CalculateFinalPrice. There are several options to reduce nesting levels in the helper methods. Use early returns or guard clauses to flatten logic, reduce indentation, and clarify flow. Use local helper functions to remove duplication and clarify intent. Use switch expressions or pattern matching to make membership logic explicit and maintainable. Use smaller methods per membership to modularize logic and make it easier to test and update. Use Boolean variables for conditions to improve readability of complex checks. The goal is to improve code maintainability and readability while preserving the existing functionality and generated output
    ```






1. Ask GitHub Copilot Agent to extract the membership discount logic from the CalculateFinalPrice method and place it in a helper method.

    For example, you can submit the following task in the Chat view:

    ```plaintext
    I need to refactor the PricingEngine class by extracting the membership discount logic from the CalculateFinalPrice method and placing it into a new helper method named CalculateMembershipDiscount. The output generated by running the app (using the built-in sample data) should not be affected by the refactoring process. Start by creating the CalculateMembershipDiscount method inside the PricingEngine class and directly below the CalculateFinalPrice method. Extract all the deeply nested conditional logic from the CalculateFinalPrice method that applies discounts based on user.Membership, baseTotal, and various user/order attributes. The CalculateMembershipDiscount helper method should take User, Order, baseTotal, and a list of applied discounts as parameters, and it should return the total membership-based discount percent to be applied.
    ```

    This task includes natural language text that explains the task and provides specifics about the new helper method to be created, including parameters and the return type. Task details are composed using information from GitHub Copilot's analysis in the previous task.

    GitHub Copilot Agent will evaluate the task and the codebase to develop an approach for refactoring CalculateFinalPrice and extracting the membership discount logic into a new helper method. The agent will test the code updates at various stages to ensure that the refactoring is successful and that the business logic remains intact.

1. Monitor the Chat view as GitHub Copilot Agent works on the task.

    The agent will provide updates on its progress, including any challenges it encounters and how it plans to address them. It may also ask for clarification or additional information if needed. If necessary, provide assistance by responding to the agent's prompts in the Chat view.

1. Once the refactoring task is complete, review the suggested updates in the Visual Studio Code editor.

    Always review the changes suggested by GitHub Copilot before accepting them. Verify that the updates align with your intended business logic, app functionality, and coding standards.

    The refactored code should include a new **CalculateMembershipDiscount** method that handles all the membership-level logic (Premium, Gold, Silver, and first-time buyer discounts). The CalculateMembershipDiscount method should be called from the CalculateFinalPrice method.

    You can reject the suggested changes if they don't meet your expectations, or you can accept a subset of the changes and reject others. Working with GitHub Copilot to refactor your code is often an iterative process that includes refining your prompts to achieve the intended results.

    If you accept GitHub Copilot's suggested updates, and then realize that the suggestions introduced issues that may be difficult to resolve moving forward, you can revert the changes by selecting **Undo Last Request** in the Chat view, or by using Visual Studio Code's undo functionality.

1. In the Chat view, to accept all edits, select **Keep**.








1. Select the new **CalculateMembershipDiscount** method.

    The method should contain the extracted membership discount logic. Notice that the deep nesting levels still exist.

1. Ask GitHub Copilot how to simplify complex conditional logic and reduce nesting levels in the CalculateMembershipDiscount method.

    For example:

    ```plaintext
    How can I simplify the complex conditional logic in the CalculateMembershipDiscount method? The method has multiple nested conditionals that apply different membership discounts based on user status and order details. What are some best practices for reducing nesting levels and improving readability? Explain the benefit of each approach when applied to this method.
    ```

1. Take a minute to review GitHub Copilot's suggestions for simplifying the conditional logic.

    GitHub Copilot will provide suggestions for simplifying the conditional logic, such as:

    - Use early returns or guard clauses to flatten logic, reduce indentation, and clarify flow.
    - Use local helper functions to remove duplication and clarify intent.
    - Use switch expressions or pattern matching to make membership logic explicit and maintainable.
    - Use smaller methods per membership to modularize logic and make it easier to test and update.
    - Use Boolean variables for conditions to improve readability of complex checks.

1. Ask GitHub Copilot to simplify complex conditional logic and reduce nesting levels in the CalculateMembershipDiscount method.

    For example:

    ```plaintext
   I need to simplify the complex conditional logic and reduce nesting levels in the CalculateMembershipDiscount method. Use early returns or guard clauses to flatten logic, reduce indentation, and clarify flow. Use local helper functions to remove duplication and clarify intent. Use switch expressions or pattern matching to make membership logic explicit and maintainable. Use smaller methods per membership to modularize logic and make it easier to test and update. Use Boolean variables for conditions to improve readability of complex checks. The goal is to improve readability while maintaining the same business logic. Apply these changes directly to the CalculateMembershipDiscount method.
    ```

1. Take a minute to review GitHub Copilot's suggestions.

1. To accept the changes, select **Keep**.

    The refactored **CalculateMembershipDiscount** method should now have reduced nesting levels and improved readability while maintaining the same business logic.







1. Select the updated **CalculateFinalPrice** method.

    The method should now call the new **CalculateMembershipDiscount** method, which encapsulates the membership discount logic.

1. In the Chat view, submit a refactoring task to extract the coupon logic.

    For example:

    ```plaintext
    I need to refactor the PricingEngine class by extracting the "coupon validation and application" conditional logic from the CalculateFinalPrice method and placing it into a new helper method named CalculateCouponDiscount. The output generated by running the app (using the built-in sample data) should not be affected by the refactoring process. Start by creating the CalculateCouponDiscount method inside the PricingEngine class and directly below the CalculateFinalPrice method. Extract all logic related to validating and applying coupon discounts, including all valid and expired coupon conditionals. The CalculateCouponDiscount helper method should take User, Order, discountPercent, the appliedDiscounts list, and the shipping cost as parameters, and it should return a tuple containing the coupon discount percent to add, and the possibly updated shipping cost.
    ```






    ```plaintext
    Now extract the coupon validation and application logic into a new helper method named CalculateCouponDiscount. This method should handle coupon validation, membership-enhanced coupons, and both percentage and shipping coupons.
    ```




1. Review the suggested updates in the Visual Studio Code editor.

    This refactoring should extract all coupon-related conditional logic into a separate method, making the coupon processing logic reusable and easier to test.

1. To accept the changes, select **Keep**.

1. In the Chat view, submit a refactoring task to extract the bulk discount logic.

    ```plaintext
    Extract the bulk purchase logic into a helper method called CalculateBulkDiscount that handles volume-based discounts based on item count.
    ```







3. Bulk Discount Helper
What to extract:
The logic that applies additional discounts for orders with 10+ or 20+ items.

Signature:

Return:
The bulk discount percent to add.

How it helps:
The main method will call this once, removing the bulk discount if/else block from the main body.















1. Review the suggested updates and then select **Keep** to accept the changes.

    This refactoring should create a new method that encapsulates the bulk discount logic.

1. Finally, submit a refactoring task to extract the shipping calculation logic.

    ```plaintext
    Create a ApplyShippingDiscount helper method that handles shipping cost calculations based on order properties and user membership level.
    ```






4. Shipping Calculation Helper
What to extract:
The base shipping calculation is already in CalculateBaseShipping.
However, ensure that all shipping logic (including coupon effects) is handled in the coupon helper, so the main method only needs to call CalculateBaseShipping and then possibly update the value from the coupon helper.

Signature:

Return:
The base shipping cost.

How it helps:
Keeps shipping logic modular and ensures the main method only needs to call this once.































1. Review the suggested updates and then select **Keep** to accept the changes.

1. Take a minute to verify that the main `CalculateFinalPrice` method is now much shorter and more readable.

    The refactored main method should primarily consist of method calls to the helper functions, making the business logic flow much clearer and easier to understand.

### Test the refactored E-commerce pricing code

Testing is crucial to ensure that your refactoring doesn't change the business logic behavior. You'll run the code with various scenarios to verify that the calculations remain consistent.

Use the following steps to complete this task:

1. Open Visual Studio Code's **TERMINAL** view.

    You can open the built-in terminal by selecting the **Terminal** menu and then selecting **New Terminal**.

1. In the TERMINAL view, navigate to the ECommercePricingEngine project directory.

1. Build the project to ensure there are no compilation errors.

    ```powershell
    dotnet build
    ```

    If there are any compilation errors, review the refactored code and fix any issues. GitHub Copilot can help resolve compilation problems if needed.

1. Run the application to test the refactored pricing logic.

    ```powershell
    dotnet run
    ```

    The application should execute without errors and display pricing calculations for various test scenarios.

1. In the Chat view, enter the following prompt to create additional test scenarios.

    ```plaintext
    Create test scenarios in the Main method that verify the refactored pricing logic works correctly. Include tests for different membership levels, coupon types, bulk orders, and edge cases. Each test should display the scenario description and final pricing results.
    ```

    This will help you create comprehensive test cases that validate your refactoring work.

1. Apply the suggested test scenarios and run the application again to verify the results.

    Compare the outputs before and after refactoring to ensure the business logic remains unchanged. The refactored code should produce identical results while being much more maintainable and readable.

### (OPTIONAL) Simplify complex conditionals in the LoanApprovalWorkflow demo app

If time permits, simplify complex conditionals in the LoanApprovalWorkflow demo app using the same process that you used to simplify pricing logic in the Loan Approval Workflow sample app.

In this optional task, you'll apply the same techniques you used in the E-commerce pricing engine to refactor the complex conditional logic in the Loan Approval Workflow demo app. You'll analyze the loan approval code, identify refactoring opportunities, and then use GitHub Copilot Agent to extract complex conditionals into smaller, focused helper methods.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The instructions for this task include the high-level process steps, but they don't include suggested prompts or detailed explanations. You can refer to the previous tasks in this exercise for examples of how to construct prompts and use GitHub Copilot effectively.

Use the following steps to complete this task:

1. Expand the **LoanApprovalWorkflow** project folder, open the **LoanApprovalDemo.cs** file, and then review the code.

1. Use GitHub Copilot to explain the **LoanApprovalDemo.cs** file, including the complex conditional logic in the `Evaluate` method of the `LoanEvaluator` class.

1. Run the LoanApprovalWorkflow project to test the initial loan approval logic and create a record of the output.

1. Use GitHub Copilot to identify code refactoring opportunities that simplify complex conditionals in the Evaluate method.

1. Use GitHub Copilot to explain the implementation of any helper methods used in the suggested refactoring.

1. Use GitHub Copilot Agent to refactor the `Evaluate` method by extracting complex conditional logic into smaller, focused helper methods.

    For example, you could have helper methods for credit score evaluation, income and employment verification, financial ratio calculations, government program eligibility, and loan terms determination.

1. Use GitHub Copilot Agent to simplify complex conditional logic and reduce nesting levels in the helper methods.

1. Test your refactored code and ensure that the loan approval demo application produces the same results as the original implementation.

## Summary

In this exercise, you learned how to use GitHub Copilot to simplify complex conditional logic in a codebase. You explored the E-commerce pricing engine and Loan Approval Workflow demo apps, identified refactoring opportunities, and used GitHub Copilot Agent to extract complex conditionals into smaller, focused helper methods. You also learned how to reduce nesting levels in the code to improve readability while maintaining the same business logic.

## Clean up

Now that you've finished the exercise, take a minute to ensure that you haven't made changes to your GitHub account or GitHub Copilot subscription that you don't want to keep. If you made any changes, revert them as needed. If you're using a local PC as your lab environment, you can archive or delete the sample projects folder that you created for this exercise.
